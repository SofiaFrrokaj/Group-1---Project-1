 ## Borough Crime Rates

 ### Complaint Rate Percentage for Each Borough
- Brooklyn: 43.5%
- The Bronx: 24.3%
- Manhattan:24.3%
- Queens: 5.2%
- Staten Island: 2.6%

### Borough with Highest/Lowest Crime Rate
Brooklyn stands out as the borough with the highest overall crime rate among the five boroughs. With a significant portion of the city's crime complaints, Brooklyn's rate is notably higher than the other boroughs.  A stark contract is Staten Island with the lowest crime rate.

Understanding these seasonal patterns can help law enforcement allocate resources more effectively and implement timely interventions, improving overall public safety throughout the year.
